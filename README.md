# michigan-creature-feature
This was a Bash Script assignment for my internship at 365 Retail Markets. This project is my first time writing bash script and I have a few stretch goals I'd like to complete! 

# To run bash script:
1. Download file in wanted directory
2. In the terminal, enter bash michigan_creature_feature.sh or ./michigan_creature_feature.sh

# How it should function:
- Ask user for input
- Displays michigan animal facts facts to user
- Asks for input to learn more
- Displays information based on input
- Ask user if they would like to know about who made the project
- End
