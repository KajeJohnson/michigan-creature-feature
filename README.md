# michigan-creature-feature
This was a Bash Script assignment I did for my internship! The purpose of this project was to practice my bash scripting skills and become more familiar with Linux Bash commands. It demostrates the usage of bash scripting varibles, conditional statements, and loops.

# To run bash script:
Download file in wanted directory
In the terminal, enter bash michigan_creature_feature.sh or ./michigan_creature_feature.sh

# How it should function:
Ask user for input
Displays michigan animal facts facts to user
Asks for input to learn more
Displays information based on input
Ask user if they would like to know about who made the project
End
